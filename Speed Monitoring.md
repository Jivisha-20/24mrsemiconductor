Speed Monitoring Relay Market Overview
-
Speed Monitoring Relays are electrical devices used to monitor the rotational speed of machines like motors, conveyors, and fans. These devices detect abnormal speed variations, such as over-speed or under-speed conditions, and trigger alarms or system shutdowns to prevent damage. They are widely applied across industries for equipment protection, process control, and safety assurance. These relays are especially crucial in applications requiring continuous, accurate monitoring of mechanical speed.
