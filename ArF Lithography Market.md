ArF Lithography Market Overview
-
A wide range of products such as smartphones and electrical appliances are becoming smaller and more functional, and all are now part of everyday life. Semiconductor lithography technology is making a significant contribution to the evolution of semiconductors (semiconductor integrated circuits), which are indispensable components of these products.

A semiconductor lithography system undertakes a process whereby highly complex circuit patterns drawn on a photomask made of a large glass plate are reduced using ultra-high-performance lenses and exposed onto a silicon substrate known as a wafer.
