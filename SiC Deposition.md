=
SiC Deposition Equipemnt Market Analysis:
-
The global SiC Deposition Equipemnt Market was valued at 184 million in 2023 and is projected to reach US$ 292 million by 2030, at a CAGR of 6.8% during the forecast period.

SiC Deposition Equipemnt Market Overview
-
The manufacturing process of silicon carbide (SiC) materials usually starts with the preparation of ingots. After this step, the ingots will be precisely sliced, carefully ground and polished, and finally transformed into high-quality silicon carbide substrates. These substrates, as key basic materials, are further formed on their surfaces through epitaxial growth technology to form a uniform and high-quality silicon carbide epitaxial wafer.
