RF Front End MMIC Market Overview
-
MMIC is a type of integrated circuit (IC) device that operates at microwave frequencies (300 MHz to 300 GHz). MMICs contain active, passive, and interconnect components. These devices typically perform functions such as microwave mixing, power amplification, low-noise amplification, and high-frequency switching. Most of MMICs are fabricated on III-V compound substrates such as GaAs, InP, and GaN, silicon and SiGe MMICs are also becoming commonplace, especially where complex mixed signal systems need to be integrated on the same chip. MMICs are the components of choice for most of high-frequency applications. They offer several advantages over their discrete or hybrid counterparts, such as reduced size, low cost, and high reproducibility and repeatable performance.
