=
JIW Wafers Market Analysis:
-
The global JIW Wafers Market was valued at 298 million in 2023 and is projected to reach US$ 466 million by 2030, at a CAGR of 6.5% during the forecast period.

JIW Wafers Market Overview
-
JIW Wafers are a type of semiconductor substrate designed to provide electrical isolation between different components on the same wafer. This isolation is achieved through pn junctions, which act as barriers to current flow between neighboring regions. Unlike Silicon-On-Insulator (SOI) wafers, JIW relies on junction-based isolation rather than an insulating oxide layer.
