Pitch and Yaw Geardrive Market Overview
-
The yaw drive is an important component of the horizontal axis wind turbines’ yaw system. To ensure the wind turbine is producing the maximal amount of electric energy at all times, the yaw drive is used to keep the rotor facing into the wind as the wind direction changes. A pitch system monitors and controls the angle of attack of the rotor blades and thus controls the speed of the rotor. Furthermore it is the main brake of a wind turbine. The pitch drive is the main part of a pitch system as it takes over the control of it.
