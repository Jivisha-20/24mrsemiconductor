**➣ By Technology:**

1.	Electrochemical Biosensors:
Electrochemical biosensors represent the largest segment in the biosensors market, holding approximately 40% of the market share in 2023. These biosensors are favored due to their high sensitivity, specificity, and relatively low cost, making them widely used in various applications such as medical diagnostics, environmental monitoring, and food safety. The ability of electrochemical biosensors to provide real-time analysis with minimal sample preparation has driven their dominance in the market. Additionally, advancements in miniaturization and the development of portable devices have further enhanced their adoption, particularly in point-of-care testing.
2.	Optical Biosensors:
Optical biosensors are the second largest segment, accounting for around 30% of the market share. These biosensors use light to detect biological reactions and offer high specificity and the capability to detect a wide range of analytes. Optical biosensors are increasingly used in applications requiring non-invasive monitoring, such as medical diagnostics and environmental monitoring. The growing demand for label-free detection methods and the integration of optical biosensors with microfluidic devices have also contributed to their significant market share.
3.	Piezoelectric Biosensors:
Piezoelectric biosensors are a growing segment, comprising about 15% of the market share in 2023. These biosensors operate based on the detection of mass changes through frequency shifts in a piezoelectric material. They are particularly useful in detecting molecular interactions and have applications in areas such as environmental monitoring and food safety. The increasing need for sensitive and rapid detection methods in these industries is driving the growth of piezoelectric biosensors.
4.	Thermal Biosensors:
Thermal biosensors, although a smaller segment, are steadily growing, holding around 10% of the market share. These biosensors detect changes in temperature caused by biochemical reactions. While they are less common than other types, their applications in specific areas, such as drug discovery and research, are expanding. The ability to provide real-time and label-free detection has made thermal biosensors a valuable tool in these niche markets.
