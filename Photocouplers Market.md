Photocouplers Market Overview
-
An optocoupler, also known as an optoisolator, is an electronic component that enables the transfer of electrical signals between two isolated circuits using light. This component typically comprises:

•	A light-emitting diode (LED)

•	A photosensitive device such as a photodiode, phototransistor, or photovoltaic cell

•	All enclosed in a single package

The key function of an optocoupler is to provide electrical isolation, which helps prevent high voltage in one circuit from affecting or damaging another, while still enabling reliable signal transmission.
