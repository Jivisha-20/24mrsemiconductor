Wafer Laser Marking Machine Market Analysis:
-
The global Wafer Laser Marking Machine Market was valued at 233 million in 2024 and is projected to reach US$ 351 million by 2031, at a CAGR of 6.2% during the forecast period.

Wafer Laser Marking Machine Market Overview
-
Laser marking machine is a device that uses high-energy laser beam to carve any desired text, graphics and images on the surface of an object. The effect of laser marking machine is to use high-energy density laser to partially irradiate the workpiece, so that the surface materials of various materials evaporate and expose the deep materials, thereby marking a permanent mark. This mark can be a beautiful pattern, trademark and text.
