=
IC and LED Lead Frames Market Analysis:
-
The global IC and LED Lead Frames Market was valued at 3546 million in 2024 and is projected to reach US$ 5210 million by 2031, at a CAGR of 5.8% during the forecast period.

IC and LED Lead Frames Market Overview
-
Lead Frame is the basic component that delivers electric signal to external circuits and supports the chip inside of semiconductor package mechanically. A lead frame consists of a die mounting paddle and lead fingers. The die paddle serves primarily to mechanically support the die during package manufacture. The lead fingers connect the die to the circuitry external to the package.
Sumitomo Metal Mining Co., Ltd. (SMM) has withdrawn from the lead frame business, based on an assessment of the changing business environment. The lead frame market itself has gone from a growth market to the mature phase, resulting in over-commoditization of lead frame products. Moreover, the emergence of Chinese local manufacturers has intensified competition for these products. On March 17, 2017, Chang Wah Technology purchased SH Asia Pacific Pte.
