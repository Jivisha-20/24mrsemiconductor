Low Leakage Diodes Market Overview
-
When the diode is cut off in the reverse direction, it is not completely ideal cut off. When subjected to back pressure, some tiny current leaks from the cathode to the anode. This current is usually small, and the higher the back pressure, the greater the leakage current, and the higher the temperature, the greater the leakage current. Large leakage current will bring large losses, especially in high voltage applications. Low leakage diodes can effectively ensure low reverse leakage current.
