Wafer Shipping Boxes Market Overview
-
Wafer Shipping Boxes are the containers to transfer the wafers safely. The Wafer Shipping Boxes can be opened and closed with the help of robot to support the existing automation in the wafer transport and shipping. The Wafer Shippers and Carriers must comply with the semiconductor industry standards such as M31, E15.1, E57, E62 and others. The wafer transport box is so designed that it increases the wafer position accuracy along with its operability. The wafer transport box offers removable gasket that provides protection for external contamination. The wafer shipping boxes, or wafer transport box are packaged in horizontal wafer shippers and vertical wafer shippers. The advanced wafer transport boxes offer benefits over the traditional mid-range and low range wafer carriers.
