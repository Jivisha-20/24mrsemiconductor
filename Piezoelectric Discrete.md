Piezoelectric Discrete Stack Actuator Market Analysis:
-
The global Piezoelectric Discrete Stack Actuator Market was valued at 597 million in 2024 and is projected to reach US$ 964 million by 2031, at a CAGR of 7.2% during the forecast period.

Piezoelectric Discrete Stack Actuator Market Overview
-
Piezoelectric discrete stack actuators are constructed with discrete sintered, poled ceramic disks, rings or plates with thin metal leaf electrodes interlaced between the ceramics. The device is bonded together with a high quality adhesive. These stack actuators are often enclosed in metal casing with an appropriate pre stress applied. Other options for these actuators can be casings specially designed to manage the heat generated during operation, or include the possibility of position sensing for the piezoelectric stack actuator.

Discrete stacking offers the widest range of ceramic materials, flexibility in the shape of the ceramic elements, and better control of heat generated during high frequency operation, but voltages of 500 V 1000 V usually are needed to operate these actuators.
