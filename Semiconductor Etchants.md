Semiconductor Etchants Market Analysis:
-
The global Semiconductor Etchants Market was valued at 1761 million in 2024 and is projected to reach US$ 2882 million by 2031, at a CAGR of 7.5% during the forecast period.

Semiconductor Etchants Market Overview
-
Semiconductor Etchant is an electronic chemical used in etching in semiconductor manufacturing.

In the electronics industry, the etching solution chemicals are varied depending on the material to be etched. For example, to perform etching of silicon (Si), a mixture of Dry Etching Agent (electronic grade) and nitric acid (electronic grade) is used. Other compounds are also added in the mixture to control the etch rate, the etch selectivity (ratio of etch rate of different materials), and the etch anisotropy (ratio of etch rate in the direction perpendicular to the surface to the etch rate in the direction parallel to the surface). The optimal etchant composition depends on the substrate and resist materials as well as the etching method.
