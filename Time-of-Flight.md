Time-of-Flight Sensors for Automotive In-Cabin Market Analysis:
-
The global Time-of-Flight Sensors for Automotive In-Cabin Market was valued at 26.3 million in 2024 and is projected to reach US$ 186 million by 2031, at a CAGR of 33.0% during the forecast period.

Time-of-Flight Sensors for Automotive In-Cabin Market Overview
-
One of the primary motivations behind fully autonomous vehicles is improving road safety. According to a recent report by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), over 90% of road accidents are due to driver errors. Eliminating human error through automation can significantly reduce accident rates.

While mass production of fully autonomous vehicles is still on the horizon, indirect Time-of-Flight (iToF) sensors are already making a meaningful contribution to road safety through Driver Monitoring Systems (DMS).
