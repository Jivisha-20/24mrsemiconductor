Roller Sensor Bar Market Overview
-
Roller sensor bar is a device used to sense the state of the drum motion. It usually consists of a long and thin strip, installed on the surface of the drum. When the drum moves, the sensor bar will be affected by the friction force of the drum or The pressure acts to produce corresponding deformation or displacement. By detecting the deformation or displacement of the sensing strip, the motion state of the roller can be judged, such as the speed and direction of the roller, etc. The roller sensing strip is widely used in various roller equipment, such as conveyors , printing machines, textile machines, etc., used to monitor and control the movement of the drum.
