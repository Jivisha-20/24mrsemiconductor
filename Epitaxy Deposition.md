Epitaxy Deposition Market Analysis:
-
The global Epitaxy Deposition Market was valued at 1420 million in 2024 and is projected to reach US$ 2422 million by 2031, at a CAGR of 8.1% during the forecast period.

Epitaxy Deposition Market Overview
-
Epitaxy refers to the deposition of an overlayer on a crystalline substrate, where the overlayer is in registry with the substrate. The overlayer is called an epitaxial film or epitaxial layer.

In most technological applications, it is crucial that the deposited material forms a crystalline overlayer with one well-defined orientation in relation to the substrate’s crystal structure (single-domain epitaxy).
