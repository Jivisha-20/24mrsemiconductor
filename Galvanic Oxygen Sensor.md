Galvanic Oxygen Sensor Market Overview
-
A galvanic oxygen sensor is a type of electrochemical sensor used to measure the concentration of oxygen in a gas or liquid. It operates based on the principle of oxygen diffusion through a permeable membrane and the subsequent electrochemical reaction that occurs at the sensor”s electrodes.

The sensor consists of two electrodes, an anode and a cathode, separated by an electrolyte. The anode is typically made of lead or silver, while the cathode is made of gold or platinum. The electrolyte is usually an alkaline solution.

When the sensor is exposed to oxygen, oxygen molecules diffuse through the permeable membrane and react with the anode, causing oxidation. This oxidation reaction generates an electrical current that is proportional to the concentration of oxygen present. The current is then measured and converted into an oxygen concentration reading.
