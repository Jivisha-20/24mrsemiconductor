Six Axis FT Sensors Market Overview
-
Six Axis Force/Torque (FT) Sensors are precision devices designed to measure force and torque along six degrees of freedom:

•	Three translational forces: X, Y, Z axes

•	Three rotational torques: Around the X, Y, Z axes

These sensors typically use strain gauge technology or similar methods to detect mechanical input and convert it into electrical signals. They are widely used in robotics, automotive, and industrial manufacturing for tasks such as:

•	Assembly

•	Haptic feedback

•	Quality control

They provide real-time feedback and enhance control in complex mechanical systems.
