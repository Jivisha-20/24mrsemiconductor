High-Purity Semiconductor Thin film (CVD, ALD) Precursor Materials Market Overview
-
Semiconductor precursors are the core manufacturing materials for semiconductor thin film deposition processes, with high barriers and high growth. They are used in semiconductor manufacturing processes to carry target elements, gaseous or volatile liquid, chemically and thermally stable, and have corresponding reactivity or physical properties. In the semiconductor manufacturing process including thin film, lithography, interconnection, doping technology, etc., the precursor is mainly used in vapor deposition (including physical deposition PVD, chemical vapor deposition CVD and atomic vapor deposition ALD), to form various film layers which meet the semiconductor manufacturing requirements. In addition, the precursor can also be used for semiconductor epitaxial growth, etching, ion implantation doping and cleaning, etc., and is one of the core materials for semiconductor manufacturing.
