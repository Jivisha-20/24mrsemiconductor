Sputtering Target for Semiconductor Market Overview
-
A sputtering target for semiconductors is a high-purity material used in the sputtering process, a form of physical vapor deposition (PVD), to create thin films on semiconductor wafers. These thin films are essential in the manufacturing of integrated circuits (ICs) and other semiconductor devices. During the sputtering process, high-energy particles (typically ions) bombard the target material, causing its atoms or molecules to be ejected and deposited onto the wafer. This method provides precise and uniform thin films, forming the various functional layers required in semiconductor devices.
