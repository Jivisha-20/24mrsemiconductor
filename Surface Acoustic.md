Surface Acoustic Wave (SAW) Biosensors Market Overview
-
Surface Acoustic Wave (SAW) biosensors are advanced sensors that utilize surface acoustic waves to detect and measure the concentration of specific biological substances in a sample. These biosensors operate by generating and detecting sound waves that travel along the surface of a solid material. A piezoelectric transducer is responsible for converting electrical signals into mechanical vibrations, which in turn generate surface acoustic waves for biosensing applications.
