Capacitive Tactile Sensor Market Overview
-
Capacitive Tactile Sensor is a type of touch sensor that detects and measures touch or pressure by changes in capacitance. Capacitance is the ability of a system to store an electric charge, and it can change when there is a change in the distance between two conductive surfaces. In the case of capacitive tactile sensors, these conductive surfaces are typically electrodes or conductive materials. Capacitive Tactile Sensor is widely used in various applications, including consumer electronics, robotics, automotive, and medical devices. They offer several advantages, such as high sensitivity, fast response time, and the ability to detect both static and dynamic touch inputs.
