GaN and SiC Power Semiconductor Market Overview
-
The power semiconductor is the core of electronic device electrical energy conversion and circuit control. In essence, it uses the unidirectional conductivity of the semiconductor to realize the function of power switch and power conversion. Whether it is hydropower, nuclear power, thermal power or wind power, or even the chemical energy provided by various batteries, most of them cannot be directly used. More than 75% of the electrical energy applications require power conversion by power semiconductor devices before they can be used by equipment.
