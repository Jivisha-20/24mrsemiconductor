300 mm Wafer CMP Retaining Rings Market Overview
-
A process for planarization of wafers is nowadays an integral part in every semiconductor production facility. This step is done before patterning the wafer to provide a flat surface for exposing different mask images on. Pressure is applied to the wafer cover usually with a slurry which will polish the wafer as well so called retaining rings are used to keep the wafer in position during the polishing process.
At present, CMP retaining rings have been widely used in the semiconductor industry. The main production enterprises are concentrated in the Asia-Pacific region. The top three companies account for more than 43% of the global revenue market share. In 2022, Willbe S&T occupied the largest revenue market share in the world with 24.98%, followed by CALITECH and Cnus Co., Ltd. with 11.21% and 7.59% global revenue market share, respectively.
