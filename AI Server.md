AI Server DrMos Power Chip Market Analysis:
-
The global AI Server DrMos Power Chip Market was valued at 244 million in 2023 and is projected to reach US$ 715 million by 2030, at a CAGR of 16.5% during the forecast period.
AI Server DrMos Power Chip Market Overview
DrMOS integrates MOSFET and driver IC, effectively improving conversion efficiency, increasing power density and reducing device size. DrMOS integrates 2 power MOSFETs and driver IC into one chip, adopts chip packaging technology, optimizes power circuit and drive circuit internally, and can minimize the influence of parasitic inductance and capacitance; in addition, the overall size of the system is further reduced, and the power density is greatly improved, which can meet the more stringent overclocking work of high-end motherboards and improve overall efficiency. DrMOS adds current and operating temperature detection functions internally, and the current and operating temperature signals are output to the PWM controller or CPU/DSP (digital controller), which can not only perform system control and feedback adjustment, but also protect the safe operation of power devices and improve system reliability. On the basis of ordinary servers, AI servers usually add 4 to 8 GPUs. The multi-phase power supply composed of multi-phase controller and DrMOS is also a power supply solution for GPUs. Compared with CPUs, GPUs have higher power consumption, and the demand for multi-phase power supplies is further increased. This report counts the AI server DrMos power chip market.
