The global Diamond Heat Spreaders Market was valued at 127 million in 2024 and is projected to reach US$ 225 million by 2031, at a CAGR of 8.8% during the forecast period.

Diamond Heat Spreaders Market Overview
-
A heat spreader transfers energy as heat from a hotter source to a colder heat sink or heat exchanger. There are two thermodynamic types, passive and active. The commonest sort of passive heat spreader is a plate or block of material having high thermal conductivity, such as copper, aluminum, or diamond. An active heat spreader speeds up heat transfer with expenditure of energy as work supplied by an external source. Diamond heat spreaders can reduce thermal management bottlenecks and achieve lower operating temperatures, improved performance and extended system life in a range of electronics applications.
