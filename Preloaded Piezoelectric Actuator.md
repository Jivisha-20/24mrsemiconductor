Preloaded Piezoelectric Actuator Market Overview
-
A preloaded piezoelectric actuator is a type of electromechanical device that utilizes the piezoelectric effect. It consists of piezoelectric materials, typically ceramic or crystal elements, which are preloaded under a certain mechanical force to ensure stable and efficient operation. When an electrical voltage is applied across these materials, they undergo precise and rapid dimensional changes, converting electrical energy into mechanical motion.
