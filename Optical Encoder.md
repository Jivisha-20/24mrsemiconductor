Optical Encoder Ics Market Analysis:
-
The global Optical Encoder Ics Market was valued at 232 million in 2024 and is projected to reach US$ 372 million by 2031, at a CAGR of 7.1% during the forecast period.

Optical Encoder Ics Market Overview
-
Optical encoders have been the popular choice in the motion control market for many years. They are comprised of an LED light source (typically infrared) and photodetectors placed on opposite sides of an encoder disk. This disk is constructed of plastic or glass and contains a series of alternating transparent and opaque lines or slots. During the rotation of the disk, the LED light path is interrupted by the alternating lines or slots on the disk, which in turn produces the typical square wave A & B quadrature pulses used to determine shaft rotation and speed.
