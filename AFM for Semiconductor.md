AFM for Semiconductor Market Analysis:
-
The global AFM for Semiconductor Market was valued at 119 million in 2024 and is projected to reach US$ 202 million by 2031, at a CAGR of 8.0% during the forecast period.

AFM for Semiconductor Market Overview
-
The Semiconductor product development cycle is one of the most intricate and data driven of all industries. As technology nodes continue to shrink below 5nm, Semiconductor manufacturers require the highest resolution, highest throughput, easiest to use equipment to meet technology development and production milestones. One of the most versatile tools for such stringent development requirements is the Atomic Force Microscope (AFM).

As semiconductor nodes shrink below 5nm, the demand for Atomic Force Microscopes (AFM) is rising due to their nanometer-level resolution and critical role in defect analysis, film thickness measurement, and nanostructure detection.
