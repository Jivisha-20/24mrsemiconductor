Low-Voltage Differential Signaling (LVDS) Chip Market Analysis:
-
The global Low-Voltage Differential Signaling (LVDS) Chip Market was valued at 251 million in 2024 and is projected to reach US$ 375 million by 2031, at a CAGR of 6.1% during the forecast period.

Low-Voltage Differential Signaling (LVDS) Chip Market Overview
-
LVDS chips are semiconductor devices that provide a means of a balanced digital transmission method. Low-voltage differential signaling, or LVDS, is a technical standard that specifies electrical characteristics of a differential, serial signaling standard, but it is not a protocol. LVDS operates at low power and can run at very high speeds using inexpensive twisted-pair copper cables. LVDS is a physical layer specification only; many data communication standards and applications use it and add a data link layer as defined in the OSI model on top of it.
