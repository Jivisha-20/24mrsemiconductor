SOC (Spin on Carbon) Hardmasks Market Overview
-
Spin-on Carbon (SOC) hardmasks can be used in multilayer lithography processes with high etch resistance, low cost of ownership, low defects, high alignment accuracy, good gap filling and topography planarization. SOC is a high carbon-containing polymer solution. As a coating material, the polymer needs to be dissolved in an organic solvent and insoluble in the upper layer of the coating after curing. The high carbon content (>80%) of the SOC is important for good etch resistance.
