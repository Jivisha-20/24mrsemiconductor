Non-Contact Passive Sensor Market Analysis:
-
The global Non-Contact Passive Sensor Market was valued at 993 million in 2023 and is projected to reach US$ 2227 million by 2030, at a CAGR of 12.6% during the forecast period.

Non-Contact Passive Sensor Market Overview
-
A non-contact passive sensor is a sensor device that does not require direct contact with the object being measured and does not rely on an external power supply. It senses or detects the target signal by utilizing the physical or electromagnetic characteristics of the external environment (such as temperature, humidity, electric field, magnetic field, etc.) and converts it into a usable output signal.
