Galvanic Cell Type Oxygen Sensors Market Overview
-
Galvanic cell type oxygen sensors are electrochemical devices used to detect and measure oxygen concentrations. The core mechanism involves an anode and a cathode immersed in an electrolyte. As oxygen penetrates a thin membrane, it reacts with electrons from the anode, creating a current proportional to the oxygen level. These sensors are widely used for their reliability, real-time detection, and ability to function without an external power source. Since the 1960s, they’ve been applied in industries for safety and oxygen deficiency alerts.
