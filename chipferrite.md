Chip Ferrite Beads Market Overview
-
In the transmission system, noise is classified in two ways: one is differential mode noise and the other is common mode noise. Chip Ferrite beads are used to clean differential mode noise generated from either the signal line or power line circuit. Chip ferrite beads are used to absorb high-frequency noise and transform it into heat, to filter out the unwanted signal (noise).
