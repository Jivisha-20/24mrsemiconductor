TRIAC Dimmable LED Driver Market Overview
-
TRIAC dimmable LED driver is a power management device that can control the phase of the input AC voltage waveform to adjust the brightness of the LED lamp. The driver starts chopping from the zero phase of the AC voltage, cuts the voltage waveform by adjusting the conduction angle, and then generates a modulated output voltage to reduce the power consumption of the load. It has a compact and lightweight design, high adjustment accuracy, easy operation, and can be controlled from a distance. The advantages of TRIAC dimmable LED driver are its high working efficiency, stable and reliable performance, and low dimming cost, so it occupies an important market position in dimming solutions.
