Epitaxial Growth Equipment Market Overview
-
Epitaxial growth equipment refers to tools and machinery used to deposit thin layers of material onto a substrate in a highly controlled manner. The process, called epitaxy, typically involves the growth of crystalline layers of semiconductor materials on a semiconductor wafer. This is a critical process in the manufacturing of devices such as microchips, LEDs, and solar cells. Epitaxial growth can be performed using techniques like Molecular Beam Epitaxy (MBE) or Metal-Organic Chemical Vapor Deposition (MOCVD), and the equipment is designed to provide precise control over temperature, pressure, and material composition to ensure the high quality of the grown layers.
