=
Extreme Ultraviolet Lithography (EUVL)  Market Analysis:
-
The global Extreme Ultraviolet Lithography (EUVL) market was valued at US$ 507.7 million in 2023 and is projected to reach US$ 1468.9 million by 2030, at a CAGR of 16.0% during the forecast period.

Extreme Ultraviolet Lithography (EUVL)Market Overview
-
“Extreme ultraviolet lithography (EUVL)” is a leading next-generation lithography (NGL) technology used to print lines as small as 30nm and develop microprocessors and microchips. This technology may replace optical lithography, which is currently used to create microcircuits. The EUVL system operates by directing strong beams of ultraviolet light reflected from a circuit design pattern onto a silicon wafer.

EUVL systems utilize extremely short wavelength technology, which can be applied down to the 10nm node. However, three significant challenges must be addressed before mass production can occur: a light power source, resistance, and mask infrastructure.
