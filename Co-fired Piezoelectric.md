Co-fired Piezoelectric Stack Actuator Market Analysis:
-
The global Co-fired Piezoelectric Stack Actuator Market was valued at 323 million in 2024 and is projected to reach US$ 484 million by 2031, at a CAGR of 5.9% during the forecast period.

Co-fired Piezoelectric Stack Actuator Market Overview
-
Co-fired piezoelectric stack actuators are co-fired multilayer actuators. These have very thin ceramic layers that are made by casting a ceramic / organic slurry to form a tape, dried, electroded with a thin precious metal electrode, usually a silver palladium electrode, the electrode tape is stacked, laminated, and fired to a dense ceramic / electrode package. The fired package is cut to size exposing the electrodes and the electrical connections are made. The stack is poled by applying a DC field to activate the piezo material and a protective insulating coating is applied. Co-fired actuators are driven by much lower voltages, 100 V-150 V.
