Power Electronic DCB &amp; AMB Substrates Market Analysis:
-
The global Power Electronic DCB &amp; AMB Substrates Market was valued at 1155 million in 2024 and is projected to reach US$ 3756 million by 2031, at a CAGR of 18.8% during the forecast period.

Power Electronic DCB &amp; AMB Substrates Market Overview
-
DCB (Direct Bonded Copper) substrates are made by bonding pure copper onto ceramic insulators like Al₂O₃ or AlN through a high-temperature eutectic process.

AMB (Active Metal Brazing) is an advanced method that brazes copper onto AlN or SiN ceramics, allowing thicker copper layers (up to 800µm) on thin substrates (0.25mm), offering excellent thermal conductivity and reliability.
