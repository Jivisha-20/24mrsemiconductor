FC BGA Market Analysis:
-
The global FC BGA Market was valued at 5286 million in 2024 and is projected to reach US$ 10420 million by 2031, at a CAGR of 10.4% during the forecast period.

FC BGA Market Overview
-
Flip Chip Ball Grid Array is a mid-cost, high-performance, semiconductor packaging solution that utilizes the controlled collapse chip connection technology, also known as flip chip, for its die to substrate interconnection. FC BGA provides the design flexibility for much higher signal density and functionality into a smaller die and packaging footprint. FC BGA packaging is attractive where performance is more important than cost. Flip-chip BGA packages can be mounted using standard printed circuit boards and can be replaced using existing standard repair practices.
