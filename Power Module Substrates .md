Power Module Substrates Market Overview
-
This report studies the ceramic substrates used in power modules. The key ceramic substrates are DBC substrates and AMB substrates. The power modules include IGBT modules and SiC modules. DBC (Direct Bonded Copper) substrates are composed of a ceramic insulator, Al2O3 or AlN onto which pure copper metal is attached by a high temperature eutectic melting process and thus tightly and firmly joined to the ceramic. Active Metal Brazing (AMB) is the latest developments in ceramic substrates and offers the ability to produce Heavy Copper with a AlN (Aluminium Nitride) or SiN (Silicon Nitride). The normal metallisation process is not used as AMB involves brazing pure copper on the ceramic in a high temperature vacuum brazing process. As well as offering a high reliability substrate with unique heat dissipation. The brazing technology also enables double sided copper weights of up to 800µm on thin ceramic substrates of just 0.25mm.
