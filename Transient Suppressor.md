Transient Suppressor (TVS) Diodes Market Overview
-
Transient Suppressor Diodes are high performance protection devices in the form of diodes. When the two poles of the TVS diode are impacted by reverse transient high energy, it can change the high impedance between the two poles into low impedance at a speed of the order of 10 to the minus 12 second, absorbing up to several kilowatts of surge power , so that the voltage between the two poles is clamped at a predetermined value, which effectively protects the precision components in the electronic circuit from damage by various surge pulses. It has the advantages of fast response time, large transient power, low leakage current, breakdown voltage deviation, easier control of clamping voltage, no damage limit, and small size. Widely used in computer systems, communication equipment, AC/DC power supplies, automobiles, electronic ballasts, household appliances, instrumentation.
