Car Key Chips Market Overview
-
A car key chip is a crucial electronic component integrated into modern car keys. It enables secure communication between the vehicle’s Engine Control Unit (ECU) and the ignition system. Here’s how it works:

•	When the key is inserted or the ignition is activated, the ECU sends an encrypted signal to the chip.

•	The chip receives and returns the correct anti-theft code.

•	Only if the code matches, the engine is authorized to start, providing a strong layer of theft prevention.
