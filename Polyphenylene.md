Electronic Grade Polyphenylene Ether Market Overview
-
The production process of polyphenylene ether includes homogeneous solution polycondensation method and precipitation polycondensation method. Among them, homogeneous solution polycondensation method is the mainstream process. The production process of polyphenylene ether is complex and the process is long. Due to technical limitations, there are few companies in the world with a production capacity of 10,000 tons of polyphenylene ether. Electronic-grade polyphenylene ether is a key material for M6 copper-clad laminates and is expected to benefit from server architecture upgrades and the growth in demand for AI servers.
