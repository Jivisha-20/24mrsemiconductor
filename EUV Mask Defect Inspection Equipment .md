EUV Mask Defect Inspection Equipment Market Analysis:
-
The global EUV Mask Defect Inspection Equipment Market was valued at 1502 million in 2024 and is projected to reach US$ 3737 million by 2031, at a CAGR of 14.3% during the forecast period.

EUV Mask Defect Inspection Equipment Market Overview
-
Mask, also known as Photomask or Reticle, is a graphic master used in the lithography process commonly used in microelectronics processing technology. As a carrier of graphic information, Mask transfers the graphic to the base material through the exposure process, thereby realizing the transfer of the graphic.

Mask defect detection is a key link in the semiconductor lithography process, which aims to check the Mask and identify and repair the defects on it.
