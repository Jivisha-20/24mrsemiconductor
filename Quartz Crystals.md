Quartz Crystals and Oscillators Market Overview
-
A crystal is a piece of piezoelectric material that generates an oscillating sinusoidal electric signal due to the mechanical vibration of its structure. Crystals vibrate at very precise frequencies, so they produce precisely tuned outputs. The crystal oscillator refers to a slice (abbreviated as a wafer) from a quartz crystal at a certain azimuth angle, a quartz crystal resonator, which is simply referred to as a quartz crystal or a crystal, and a crystal oscillator; and a crystal element in which an IC constitutes an oscillation circuit is added inside the package is called Crystal oscillator.
