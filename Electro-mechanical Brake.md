Electro-mechanical Brake Market Overview
-
Electro-Mechanical Brake, also called electro-mechanical brake is a mechanical part that stops or decelerates moving parts in a machine. The brake is mainly composed of a brake frame, brake parts and a control device. Some brakes are also equipped with an automatic adjustment of the brake clearance. In order to reduce the braking torque and structure size, the brake is usually installed on the high-speed shaft of the equipment, but large equipment with high safety requirements (such as mine hoists, elevators, etc.) should be installed on the low-speed shaft near the working part of the equipment on.
